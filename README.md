## Competition: CTSP Data for Social Good
- [CTSP competition projects](https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/data-for-good-projects/)

## Project Intro:

Oakland has one of the highest crime rates in California, 153 crimes per 1,000 residents. In violent crime volume, Oakland is second only to Los Angeles, which has 10x the number of residents. In non-violent crime volume, Oakland is ranked fourth overall. We plan to address Oaklandâ€™s crime problem by creating an app that predicts crime, making citizens more crime-aware so that they will better understand their crime risk. Our app will also provide crime education to citizens, informing them of crime predictors. To facilitate community involvement in reducing crime, our app will also serve as a platform for community discussions. Our app will be open-source and the data inputs will be from publicly available data to encourage algorithmic fairness discussions and actions. We aim to reduce crime by promoting crime awareness, crime education, and community engagement.
